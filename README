        In table above, 1st col is X-values, 2nd and 3d are Y1 and Y2-values.
        Matplotlib function plot() expect X-points-vector (arg1) and
        Y-points-vector(arg2).  The c[][] is matrix where c[0] is vector
        holding 1st col from above table, c[1] is second column and so on.
        Asciidoc will produce from this html file and beautiful
        (AA + subpixel resolution) FIG1.PNG

INSTALL
        - install matplotlib
        - cd mplw; make install  # this will create 2 files: /etc/asciidoc/filters/mpl/{mpl.conf,mplw.py}


ABOUT
        This is filter for asciidoc.  It based on GNU licensed graphviz2png.py by Gouichi
        Iisaka .  I actully don't know python.  I've just replaced small section in it
        (marked with ### ###, search for "lvv"),  did a lot of
        "s/graphviz/mpl/", found some sample code on the net for reading files in
        python and cobbled up the mplw.py (matplotlib wrapper).
