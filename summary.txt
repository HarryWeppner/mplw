Matplotlib (MPL) is python charting library, with function similar to Gnuplot
and interface modelled on Matlab API.  AsciiDoc is converter from ascii text
files (with human readable markup) to html and other
doc formats. This site is made with AsciiDoc. 
The MPLW is MPL wrapper, which can work as AsciiDoc filter.  This means
that AsciiDoc document can have snippets of MPL commands to generate charts.
