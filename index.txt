= MPLW - MatPlotLib  AsciiDoc Filter


Usage
-----

In asciidoc file:

---------------------------------------
include::example.asciidoc[]
---------------------------------------

Will produce following picture: 

include::example.asciidoc[]
        
In source table above, 1st col is X-values, 2nd and 3d are Y1 and Y2-values.
Matplotlib function plot() expect X-points-vector (arg1) and
Y-points-vector(arg2).  The c[][] is matrix where c[0] is vector
holding 1st col from above table, c[1] is second column and so on.
Asciidoc will produce from this html file and `example.png`


Install
-------

-------------
emerge  matplotlib  python  asciidoc
git clone git://github.com/lvv/mplw.git
cd mplw.git
make install  # this will create 2 files: /etc/asciidoc/filters/mpl/{mpl.conf,mplw.py}
--------------

Replace `emerge` above with your distro package manager.


About
------
This is filter for asciidoc.  It based on GNU licensed graphviz2png.py by Gouichi
Iisaka .  I actully don't know python.  I've just replaced small section in it
(marked with ### ###, search for "lvv"),  did a lot of
"s/graphviz/mpl/", found some sample code on the net for reading files in
python and cobbled up the mplw.py (matplotlib wrapper).

Todo
----
* When mplw.py used not as asciidoc filter:
  - if title not set take file name as title
  - if multiple input files specirfied: make one overlayed chart
