MPLW - Matplotlib  AsciiDoc filter
==================================

:html_description:	Matplotlib (MPL) is python charting library, with function similar to Gnuplot and interface modelled on Matlab API. AsciiDoc is converter from ascii text files (with human readable markup) to html and other doc formats. This site is made with AsciiDoc.  The MPLW is MPL wrapper, which can work as AsciiDoc filter.  This means that AsciiDoc document can have snippets of MPL commands to generate charts.

Introduction
------------

Let say we need 'sin(x)' chart like this:
include::example-sin.txt[]

We just include in asciidoc document following MPL code snippet:
---------------------------------------
include::example-sin.txt[]
---------------------------------------
Asciidoc will send inline python code between "----" lines to stdin of mplw.py,
and generate HTML file with <img ...> tag for MPLW produced PNG file. 

["graphviz", "flow.png"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph G {
	rankdir=LR;
	node [shape=plaintext];
	{  node [shape=box];   AsciiDoc;   MPLW; }
	{  rank=same;          "PNG file";  "HTML file"; }

	"source TXT file"  ->  AsciiDoc                                        ->  "HTML file";
	                       AsciiDoc   ->  "MPL script snippet"  ->  MPLW   ->  "PNG file";
}                                                                                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Now let say we have some data from two experiments and we need a chart like this:
include::example-data.txt[]
It can be made with this:
---------------------------------------
include::example-data.txt[]
---------------------------------------

Text after +"____"+ is plot data in table form.  The c[][] is matrix where c[0] is vector
holding 1st column from above table, c[1] is second column and so on.

Install
-------
Replace `emerge` with your distro package manager:

---------------------------------------------
emerge -u matplotlib asciidoc git 	# python and  numpy can be pulled as dependencies
git clone git://github.com/lvv/mplw.git
cd mplw.git
make install          # this will create 2 files: /etc/asciidoc/filters/mpl/{mpl.conf,mplw.py}
---------------------------------------------

MPLW was tested only with Matplotlib version 0.98.

How MPLW API differ from MPL
----------------------------
MPL API was somewhat simplified for use as AsciiDoc filter.

* Python inline code evaluated in environment with following modules imported without namespace:
-------------------------------
from matplotlib.pyplot import *                                                                                                          
from numpy import *                                                                                                          
-------------------------------

* If there is inline plot data, MPLW fills in 'c' matrix.  If entry looks like number it is converted to float. 
* If 'style' is other then `"none"`, then it is applied.
* After MPL inline code evaluated,  mplw.py writes chart PNG file. You must not call MPL's show() function.
* There is also plotting function 'benchmark' available, based on 'barh'.  It should probably be
  in MPL code, not in MPLW. I will send patch to MPL project.
  See http://volnitsky.com/project/lvvlib/array[example use of benchmark]

Currently there is '"asciidoc"' -- only and default style recognized by MPLW.
If MPL version is below or equal 0.092, then style is ignored.  When style is a '"asciidoc"', mplw will:

- adjust figure borders sizes to accommodate tick text and x/ylabel text.
  MPL does not do it automatically, it only have correct frame size if image have default size.
- enable grid.
- set figure frame background to light grey and darker grey for frame
  border. Note: there is bug in MPL, borders drawn not on all sides.

About
-----
MPLW is based on GNU licensed graphviz2png.py by Gouichi Iisaka. 
MPLW is currently in alpha state, API not yet stable. 


Todo
----
* Code cleanup and make tabs size consistent in mplw.py source
* Testing was done only with xhtml11 backend
* For inline-data add optional column header line,  which can be used for plot legend
* When mplw.py used not as asciidoc filter (but as utility generating PNGs from text files):
  - if title not set take file name as title
  - if multiple input files specified: make one overlay-ed chart
* PNG size should be specified in filter parameters and passed to MPLW (I don't know how to do this)
* PNG should be centered be default or at least filter should accept param `align=center` (don't know how to do this)
* SVG? (MPL can generate SVG)
